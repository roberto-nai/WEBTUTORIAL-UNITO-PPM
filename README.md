# WEBTUTORIAL-UNITO-PPM

## Overview
This repository contains a set of scripts designed for processing event logs and performing predictive analysis using Process Mining techniques. The workflow consists of three main steps: data cleaning, encoding, and prediction.

## Scripts

### `01_log_clean.ipynb`
This script is responsible for cleaning the input event log data. It removes inconsistencies, missing values, and ensures the dataset is prepared for further processing.

### `02_log_encoding.ipynb`
This script performs the following tasks:
- **Prefixing:** Generates event prefixes based on predefined configurations.
- **Encoding:** Converts traces into a structured format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Variants:** Supports different encoding techniques such as `BE` (Basic Encoding), `FE` (Feature Encoding), and `IE` (Index Encoding).

### `03_log_prediction.ipynb`
This script executes predictive tasks on the encoded event log data, applying machine learning models to forecast outcomes based on historical traces. The results include performance metrics and evaluations.

## Directory Structure

`config`  
Contains initial configuration files.  
`data_encoding`  
Stores the encoded event log data generated by 02_log_encoding.ipynb.  
`data_log`  
Contains the cleaned event log processed by 01_log_clean.ipynb.  
`data_ml`  
Stores the prediction results and performance metrics from 03_log_prediction.ipynb.  
`data_prefix`  
Holds the prefixed event sequences obtained from 02_log_encoding.ipynb.
